"""Common worker application module. Provides the interface with which
producers and executors see the task system.

.. class:: _TaskCaller

   This object represents a task that may be called synchronously in the
   current process, or asynchronously by a separate worker process.

   .. method:: delay(*args, **kwargs)

      Convenience method for calling :meth:`.apply_async` in a more
      traditional fashion.

      :param args: Positional arguments passed in to the task function.
      :type args: positional arguments
      :param kwargs: Keyword arguments passed in to the task function.
      :type kwargs: keyword arguments
      :returns: A way to retrieve the result of the task's execution when it
                is ready.
      :rtype: :class:`AsyncResult`

   .. method:: apply_async(args, kwargs=None, correlation_id=None,
                           routing_key=None, send_result=False, **log_extra)

      Triggers the asynchronous execution of a task by a separate worker
      process. Tasks will be executed in the order they are triggered, so a
      task may not be executed immediately.

      :param args: Positional arguments to be passed in to the task function.
      :type args: list
      :param kwargs: Keyword arguments to be passed in to the task function.
      :type kwargs: dict
      :param correlation_id: Force the message to use a specific correlation
                             identifier string.
      :type correlation_id: str
      :param routing_key: Override the default AMQP routing key for the task
                          with the given string.
      :type routing_key: str
      :param send_result: Create a temporary result queue and request that the
                          worker publish the task's result to it.
      :type send_result: bool
      :param log_extra: Additional information passed in to the log message
                        indicating the task was queued.
      :type log_extra: keyword arguments
      :returns: If ``send_result`` is True, used retrieve the result of the
                task's execution when it is ready. Otherwise, returns ``None``.
      :rtype: :class:`AsyncResult`

   .. method:: apply(args, kwargs=None, correlation_id=None)

      Calls the task function synchronously in the current process, returning
      the result. This is equivalent to a normal function call, except
      start and finish events are logged.

      :param args: Arguments passed directly into the function.
      :type args: list
      :param kwargs: Arguments passed directly into the function.
      :type kwargs: dict
      :param correlation_id: The task being executed had this string as its
                             correlation identifier.
      :type correlation_id: str
      :returns: The return value of the function call.

   .. method:: __call__(*args, **kwargs)

      Equivalent to :meth:`.apply` passing in ``args`` and ``kwargs``.

      :param args: Arguments passed directly into the function.
      :type args: positional arguments
      :param kwargs: Arguments passed directly into the function.
      :type kwargs: keyword arguments
      :returns: The return value of the function call.
