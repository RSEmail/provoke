"""Common database module. Provides a central point where databases may be
configured, and a context manager to ensure connections are closed after use.

.. py:class:: _MySQLContext

   This is the object returned by the :class:`MySQLConnection` context manager.

   .. py:attribute:: conn

      Database connection object, conforming to the Python DB API 2.0. This
      connection is already open and will be closed when the context manager
      exits.

   .. py:attribute:: params

      Contains a dictionary of the parameters used to create the database
      connection.

   .. py:attribute:: module

      A reference to the module containing the DB API 2.0 interface that the
      connection was made with. This is useful for accessing exception classes.
